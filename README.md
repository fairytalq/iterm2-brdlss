iterm2-brdlss
-------------------------

This repo contains the patch file used to remove borders and add padding to current iTerm2.
It was worked from [jaredculp/iterm2-borderless-padding](jaredculp/iterm2-borderless-padding) for my personal use. It looks for the iTerm2 repo in the above directory and builds it from there. See jaredculp description for more details.

The new binary will be located at `iTerm2/build/Development/iTerm2.app`.
